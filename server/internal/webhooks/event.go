// Package webhooks implements the generic event-driven webhook ingress for
// the PUL-102 multi-PR cascade autonomy feature. PR2 ships the dormant
// router skeleton — Source interface, HMAC verification, /webhooks/{source}
// endpoint, stub adapters — without writing to the database. PR3 fills in
// the real GitHub adapter and persistence to cascade_retrigger (added by
// PR1's migration 072). PR4 builds the background worker that consumes
// those rows.
//
// Design contract from the plan (rev 3 commit 2adceac):
//   - Handler returns 200 in well under 1s (target p99 ≤ 1s). The router
//     does HMAC + payload-version check + normalize only; no heavy work
//     happens synchronously.
//   - HMAC verification accepts the current secret AND, during rotation,
//     a previous secret — enabling 24h zero-downtime key rotation per
//     the secret-rotation procedure in the plan.
//   - Generic by design (E1). GitHub is the first of N sources. Linear,
//     Slack, GitLab, etc. plug in by registering a new Source.
//
// PR2 is wired behind the MULTICA_CASCADE_WEBHOOK_ENABLED env var: when
// the flag is off the route is not registered at all, so the dormant
// scaffold cannot accept or process any request in production until
// PR8's rollout flips the flag.
