-- PUL-177 augments this query with the latest applied skill per
-- issue, used by the Inbox phase + last-applied-skill chips in
-- InboxListItem.
--
-- We use a CTE + LEFT JOIN rather than LATERAL or scalar subqueries
-- because sqlc's nullability inference treats LEFT JOIN columns as
-- nullable (good — issues with no skill history return NULL slug/
-- status) but treats LATERAL / scalar subquery columns as the
-- underlying NOT NULL column type, which then blows up Scan() on
-- legacy issues. DISTINCT ON (issue_id) ORDER BY updated_at DESC
-- is index-driven by idx_issue_skill_state_issue_updated.

-- Archive all inbox items belonging to "representatives" whose newest non-archived item
-- is read. A group is an issue (when issue_id is set) or a single standalone
-- item (when issue_id is NULL). This matches the inbox UI's dedup-by-issue
-- semantic: the list shows one row per issue keyed on the newest non-archived
-- inbox_item, so "Archive all read" should archive entire issues that the user
-- sees as read. Per-row archiving (the previous behavior) hid the read row but
-- exposed older unread siblings, flipping the issue from "read" to "unread"
-- in the list (PUL-39).
